# Learnyounode

This was a very tough exercise for me, at the beginning of every new exercise i felt like it was in chinese. But after the exercise a few times i finished the first 5 exercises.

I found the [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) site very usefull for the fs module.

I also found [these](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMvqHOn27ZOMbDuJUssWnjg) youtube vids very usefull.

I hope to finish the exercise next week when i have more time but for now i have spent more then six hours on the assignment.

Annotations also helped me to understand what i was doing better. I only did it for the fifth exercise but wil keep on doing it for every exercise now.
